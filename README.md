# About the project

"March - The game" is a five-day project created as part of the microverse curriculum. The main goal of the project is to showcase the ability to transform business requirements into solutions, as well as showing the ability to work with JavaScript, including but not limiting:

- Babel
- API, and therefore async functions
- Webpack
- Modularize code
- Tests

It is also an excellent opportunity to learn and work with a different framework such as Phaser.

The game itself is level-based, with the possibility of increasing the score by collecting coins and chests. Be careful with the mummies, though! The controls are the left, right, and up keys.

Enjoy it!
