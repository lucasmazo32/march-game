# Game
![March Capture](/src/assets/march-shoot.png)

March game is a game that has the classic run style. When I got the assignment, I knew that I wanted a level-based game, in which you have to get to a certain point to win. 

The game's score depends on how fast the player reaches the penguin (and if it takes all the extra points, like coins or chests). I looked for material that best fitted my goal and started developing level by level. 

The game starts easy, and I added more difficulty through the rest of them. You will only need to use the arrows (up, left and right) to play, and is easy and fun to play around.

For the final touch, I created as many necessary buttons as the game needed to navigate the different screens without the need to restart the page.

# About the project


"March - The game" is a five-day project created as part of the microverse curriculum. The project's main goal is to showcase the ability to transform business requirements into solutions and show the ability to work with JavaScript, including but not limiting:


- Babel
- API, and therefore async functions
- Webpack
- Modularize code
- Tests

It is also an excellent opportunity to learn and work with a different framework such as Phaser.

The game itself is level-based, with the possibility of increasing the score by collecting coins and chests. Be careful with the mummies, though! The controls are the left, right, and up keys.

Enjoy it (Get to that penguin)!
